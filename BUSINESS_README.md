# Ar-Rahnu Islamic Pawn Broking System - Business Guide

## Executive Overview

The Ar-Rahnu Islamic Pawn Broking System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to manage Shariah-compliant pawn broking operations. This system enables Islamic financial institutions to provide ethical gold-backed financing services while maintaining full compliance with Islamic banking principles.

## What is Ar-Rahnu?

**Ar-Rahnu** (Arabic: الرهن) is an Islamic pawn broking system that provides Shariah-compliant financing by accepting gold or other valuables as collateral (pledge). Unlike conventional pawn broking:

- **No Interest (Riba)**: Loans are provided as Qard Hasan (benevolent loans) without interest
- **Safekeeping Fees (Ujrah)**: Customers pay only for the storage and safekeeping of their pledged items
- **Transparent Pricing**: All fees are disclosed upfront and calculated fairly
- **Ethical Operations**: Full compliance with Islamic Shariah principles

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Safekeeping Fees (Ujrah al-Wadiah)**
   - Monthly or daily storage fees for pledged gold items
   - Calculated as a percentage of the loan amount or fixed rate per gram
   - Transparent and disclosed at contract signing

2. **Renewal Fees**
   - Administrative charges for contract extensions
   - Covers processing and documentation costs

3. **Appraisal Services**
   - Professional gold valuation services
   - Market-rate assessments based on current gold prices

### Shariah Compliance Framework

#### Key Principles

1. **Qard Hasan (Interest-Free Loan)**
   - Principal amount must be returned exactly as borrowed
   - No profit margin on the loan itself
   - Grace periods for customers facing financial difficulties

2. **Rahn (Pledge/Collateral)**
   - Gold items held as security (Marhun)
   - Customer retains ownership of pledged items
   - Items returned upon full repayment

3. **Wadiah (Safekeeping)**
   - Institution acts as custodian of pledged items
   - Responsible for secure storage and insurance
   - Charges only for actual safekeeping costs (Ujrah)

4. **Transparent Operations**
   - All terms clearly explained to customers
   - Written contracts (Aqad) documenting all agreements
   - Regular audits to ensure Shariah compliance

   - Risk assessment considerations

Current Market Price: RM 280 per gram (916)
